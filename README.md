The `raschdash` package generates dashboards to explore Rasch-model
calibrations and diagnostics. The dashboards are intended to be used
with relatively small datasets, but the underlying modelling code is
applicable to larger tests and experiments as well. All calibrations and
diagnostics in `raschdash` are fully Bayesian, and the diagnostics are
based on Lindley information and entropy in the posterior and posterior
predictive distributions.
