# raschdash

[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The `raschdash` package provides two sets of tools.

   1. Fully Bayesian Rasch models with calibrations and diagnostics for
      binary, binomial, and rating-scale items. All calibrations and diagnostics 
      in `raschdash` are fully Bayesian. The diagnostics are based on Lindley 
      information and entropy in the posterior and posterior predictive 
      distributions.

   2. Templates for visualising the calibrations and diagnostics from these
      models, including space to add comments per cohort. The dashboards are 
      intended for relatively small datasets, such as would occur in classroom 
      settings.
